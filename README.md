# Fitt Diff Tool

Built in Vue/Vite based on a request in corp chat to get the changelogs running.

Doesn't know anything about what mods are being swapped for what, but tells you what has changed at least.  That would absolutely be project bloat (mind you, I started building the API to support that functionality.)
